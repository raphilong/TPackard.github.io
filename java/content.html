	<h2>Pathfinder</h2>
	The pathfinder has been updated, and it now works 99% of the time (I have yet to see it fail).
	 I plan to continue to improve it in subtle ways, but the basic algorithm is finished (for now).
	 You can click or drag anywhere to place walls.
	 To run the program, simply double-click pathfinder.jar.

	<h2>Platformer Game</h2>
	In my free time, I've been working on a basic platformer which I've coded from scratch in Java.
	 You can check it out by downloading it below.
	 The controls are WASD to move and space to shoot.
	 Unfortunately, I will no longer be able to update it.
