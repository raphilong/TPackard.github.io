			<h2>Pathfinder</h2>
			I've been working on A* pathfinding, and this is the result so far.
			 It's very limited, but you can click anywhere and the character will travel there.
			 The green node is where the path starts, and the red node is where it ends.
			 You can click or drag anywhere to place walls.
			 To run the program, simply double-click pathfinder.jar.

			<h2>Platformer Game</h2>
			In my free time, I've been working on a basic platformer which I've coded from scratch in
			 java. You can check it out by downloading it below. The controls are WASD to move and
			 space to shoot. Unfortunately, I will no longer be able to update it.
