			<h2>Pathfinder</h2>
			I've been working on A* pathfinding, and this is the result so far. It's very limited,
			 and doesn't allow obstacles yet, but you can click anywhere and the blue circle will
			 travel there. The green node is where the path starts, and the red node is where it ends.
			 To run the program, simply double-click pathfinder.jar.

			<h2>Platformer Game</h2>
			In my free time, I've been working on a basic platformer which I've coded from scratch in
			 java. You can check it out by downloading it below. The controls are WASD to move and
			 space to shoot. Currently, there is no objective, but I plan to fix that soon, along
			 with adding better art and a theme. My latest update has added AI that try to shoot you.
			 You can see your score on the top left and your health on the top right. Killing an AI
			 earns you ten points, while getting killed subtracts ten points. There is no end to the
			 game yet, so points don't mean much. The AI's pathfinding abilities are very limited and
			 crude, but I'm working on making them much better. Look forward to them in the next update.
